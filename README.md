# Neologism
Quick search for neologisms in the text.

## Results
The average reading speed of a person is 150-220 words per minute. Therefore, reading the text of 1,000 words a person spends 5.5 minutes.
Using the Neosearch, we search for this text in 5 minutes.
Thus, our application helps to reduce search time neologisms in text 1.1 times and do not waste time reading.
